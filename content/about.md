tinytoolk.it came about as a result of [jarkman] and [samw] being in a pub in
Scunthorpe one evening in late 2023. The former is a long term compiler of tiny
toolkits for personal and professional use, and the latter had been eyeing them
enviously for some time.

They both thought that there would probably be some other such inclined people online
and that perhaps there should be a place to gather and write about such things.

By the time they left the table that evening the domain was bought, the site up, and the
first few tools had been photographed (and two members of pub staff thoroughly
perplexed).
